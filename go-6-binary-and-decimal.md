# Binary and Decimal

## 1. Introduction: Numerals, numbers, and quantity

- **Numeral** : a symbol or a group of characters that represent a number1

- **A number**: represent a quantity, something that we can count.

- **A numeral**: is a representation of a number.

- **A numeration system**: is a set of rules that allow us to count things and to represent quantities.

Every day we manipulate numbers represented with the decimal system: 10.254 , 125, 2020, 31 .…

But **the decimal system is not the only one** and was not always used.

We can represent numbers using other numeration systems.

- Let’s take as an example the quantity “one hundred twenty-three”

    “123” represent this quantity in the decimal system
    - The numeral is “123”
    “1111011” represent this quantity in the binary system
    - The numeral is “1111011”
    “7B” represent this quantity in the hexadecimal system
    - The numeral is “7B”
    “173” represent this quantity in the octal system
    - The numeral is “173”

The same quantity, the same underlying reality can be expressed in different forms.

Why is it important to understand that? Because computers will not store data using the decimal system. At the physical level, information is stored using zeros and ones.

This chapter will detail how the decimal system and the binary system work.

## 2. Etymology and symbols

Decimal comes from the Latin word “Decimus” which means “tenth”. Whereas binary comes from the Latin “bini” which means “two together”. The etymology of those two words give us a hint about how those systems are constructed :

- The binary system uses two symbols which are 0 and 1

- The decimal system uses ten symbols which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Data written using the binary system will be written using “0” and “1”. For instance, 101010 is written using the binary encoding system.

Data written using the decimal system will be written using 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. For instance, 42 is written using the decimal system. The number 10 can be encoded using the binary system or the decimal system (and thus, it will not represent the same underlying quantity).
